# SimpleMoviesKotlinApp

This is a simple project that has just been started as a personal challenge.

It is a project that implements the ``TheMovieDB`` ([https://www.themoviedb.org/]) Apis in order to list the most recent movies and checking out each movie's details.

It will use the following:

* `` Kotlin `` [https://kotlinlang.org/]
* `` Clean Architecture `` [https://8thlight.com/blog/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html]
* `` Architecture components `` [https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/]
* `` Kodein DI `` [https://github.com/Kodein-Framework/Kodein-DI]
* `` RxKotlin `` [https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxKotlin]
* `` RxAndroid `` [https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxAndroid]
* `` Data binding `` [https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding/?hl=pt-br]
* `` Retrofit `` [https://square.github.io/retrofit/]
* `` Gson `` [https://github.com/google/gson]
* `` Timber `` [https://github.com/JakeWharton/timber]
* `` Glide `` [https://github.com/bumptech/glide]
* `` JUnit 5 `` [https://junit.org/junit5/]
* `` MockK `` [https://github.com/mockk/mockk]
* `` Kluent `` [https://github.com/MarkusAmshove/Kluent]

Its goal is to just provide a simple way of implementing a project from scratch using a boilerplate that is customizable. 
The app has started to be implemented using TDD (Test Driven Development), for more details check the following video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkblc5WRn-U]
All the layers contain tests, depending on which is the layer it could contain Unit testing, UI testing or both.
