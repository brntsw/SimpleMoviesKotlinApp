# SimpleMoviesKotlinApp

This is a simple project that has just been started as a personal challenge. It will use the following:

** Kotlin ** [https://kotlinlang.org/]
** Clean Architecture ** [https://8thlight.com/blog/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html]
** Architecture components ** [https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/]
** Dagger2 ** [https://github.com/google/dagger]
** RxJava 2 ** [https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava]
** Data binding ** [https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding/?hl=pt-br]
** Retrofit ** [https://square.github.io/retrofit/]
** Gson ** [https://github.com/google/gson]

Its goal is to just provide a simple way of implementing a project from scratch using a boilerplate that is customizable. 
All the layers contain tests, depending on what is the layer it could contain Unit testing, UI testing or both
